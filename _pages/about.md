# About Me
* I am a Doctoral Researcher at the [BMW Autonomous Driving](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/innovation/technologies-and-mobility/autonomes-fahren/campus.html), Munich, supervised by [Prof. Walter Stechele](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lis/persons/management/walter-stechele/) and [Naveen Shankar Nagaraja](https://menaveenshankar.github.io/).
* I am pursuing my Ph.D. in [Chair of Integrated Systems](https://www.ei.tum.de/lis/startseite/) from [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). I completed my masters in Communication Engineering (https://www.ei.tum.de/msce/home/) with a specialization in computer architecture, machine learning. 
* My research deals with compression and acceleration of computer vision models (classification/object detection/semantic segmentation), particularly designing efficient neural networks using quantization and pruning methods. Recently, I have been investigating the influence between adversarial robustness and model compression.
